<h2 id="austria-v-france">Austria v France</h2>
<p><img alt="46701d3988ea602643ec17adfedc1475.jpg" src="../46701d3988ea602643ec17adfedc1475.jpg"></p>
<p>France stand tall. Never wavering Austria. Are France a glorified England? Huge HUGE kudos to Austria for going toe to toe with one of the best national teams and heavy favorites and only conceded once and that was really unlucky as we got the first own goal of this tournament. Austria worked so hard in this match and had a few what if moments where they could have had a famous goal but the referee being too card happy and also making a few wrong calls ruined this great match in all honesty. Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<h2 id="1st-half">1st Half</h2>
<p>We start first at minute 7 where Mbapp√© is sent through from the left, and he has a clear shot at goal but Pentz was equal to it, parrying it into the side netting. Then came controversy. In minute 35, first we have a really solid chance from Austria where Gregoritsch got the ball on the left and put in a really great cross which found Sabitzer who cushioned it beautifully for Baumgartner but Maignan rushed out forward quickly to deny him. It was an amazing save, but the controversy was after that. On replay, there was no evidence to suggest the ball struck Baumgartner after Maignan saved it so it typically should have been a corner, but the referee instead gave a goal kick. It was a weird one, but as far as I know I don&rsquo;t think VAR is used in these kinds of scenarios, so that was a shame. A few minutes pass and Mbapp√© came down the right-hand side and put a cross in, and it was deflected in by Wober. It was a horrible miscommunication where the CB&rsquo;s were fairly narrow which was really unlucky and France took the lead.</p>
<h2 id="2nd-half">2nd Half</h2>
<p>We see a bit of a pattern here, and I&rsquo;m thinking back to the England v Serbia match which we just saw where England scored and sat back absorbing the pressure. Mbapp√© absolutely botched a one on one he&rsquo;s usually score in his sleep after he managed to beat Wober for pace, and he decided to bend the ball wide of the right side post with only the keeper to beat. There was another poor moment from the referee where from a free kick Mbapp√© caught the shoulder of Danso with his nose(Which isn&rsquo;t a good part of your body to catch someone&rsquo;s shoulder) and his nose was broken as a result. On inspection after the game he is cleared to wear a mask if he does play the next match. There is only one clear answer on what mask for him to wear: Donatello from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles üòÇüòÇ. In all seriousness, I hope he gets better from it. There was another hit as well for Griezmann, who hit the advertising board from the challenge by Wober and he had to nurse a cut to the head. Mbapp√© was carded because for some bizarre reason Austria were allowed a sub but France weren&rsquo;t so Mbapp√© decides to go back on the pitch before sitting down and was weridly carded for this. It was the REF who made this mistake in the first place üòë. There was another chance to finally kill the game off when Kolo Muani got to the right byline and crossed it in for Giroud but Danso got a slight touch which left him kicking air sadly. And it ended as it was. I am confused about how France deal with games now because this was very similar to how they dealt with England. In simple terms it seems that they are a version of England under Southgate. The only difference here is they have way too much individual quality to lose. I feel bad because they have the quality to play some class ball. Both England AND France. Anyways, win is a win. 3 points. Keep it moving.</p>
<h1 id="player-of-the-match---ngolo-kant√©">Player of the Match - N&rsquo;Golo Kant√©</h1>
<p><img alt="e2aef8e1fa3a8605d1e429be85aeb877.png" src="../e2aef8e1fa3a8605d1e429be85aeb877.png"></p>
<p>A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away we got this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;70% of the Earth is covered by water and the rest is covered by N&rsquo;Golo Kant√©&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today was just another example of that vintage Kant√© that I&rsquo;ve always loved. The only shame is that he&rsquo;s become too injury prone for top European club football, but on the international stage at least he&rsquo;s showing everyone else why he got this quote for himself. He absolutely ran that midfield and never let ANY Austrian player have a moment&rsquo;s peace on the ball WHENEVER they attacked. That midfield of Kant√©, Rabiot and Griezmann is an absolute god-tier workhorse midfield and Kant√© is at the heart of it once again. I feel bad for the likes of Tchouameni and Camavinga who deserve a start on form.</p>
