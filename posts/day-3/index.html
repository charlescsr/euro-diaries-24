<h2 id="serbia-v-england">Serbia v England</h2>
<p><img alt="291e20c9e4fb96765ae7745758b6a9d9.jpg" src="../291e20c9e4fb96765ae7745758b6a9d9.jpg"></p>
<p>Bullet Bellingham. Boregate at his finest. This approach will bite back at you. We had a draw at the end of Day 2 and now Day 3 starts off with this utter borefest. Honestly, I watched this in the middle of the night, and it put me to sleep almost instantly, post the Bellingham goal. You know what&rsquo;s coming. Let&rsquo;s get into it</p>
<h2 id="1st-half">1st Half</h2>
<p>We start at minute 13 where Walker finds Saka with a great ball, and he sneaked past Pavlovic to put a cross in and Bellingham was quick overpowering Milenkovic and putting a bullet header past Rajkovic to put England ahead. After that&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;radio silence in terms of what they were creating 😐. Trent made a colossal mistake sitting in front of the defense(Still don&rsquo;t know what this idiot sees in him to play CDM over the likes of Gallagher and Mainoo) but Mitrovic blazed it just wide of the goal. Towards the end, you could see Serbia being given the freedom. I saw this happening like for like in the final they bottled against Italy where they went ahead and then they sat back&hellip;AT 1-0. I JUST MENTIONED THAT 1-0 IS A DANGEROUS SCORELINE the previous day 😡.</p>
<h2 id="2nd-half">2nd Half</h2>
<p>Anyway, going into the second half it was Serbia all over England, but they just couldn&rsquo;t bundle it in. You got some England chances like Walker putting it across the box with no England players(Testament to how they decided to play 😒) and there was another where Bowen who was subbed on for Saka put a peach of a cross for Kane, and he could only head it near Rajkovic instead of picking a corner you know like a proper ST does(Story of his game honestly. Him and Foden were very isolated which was really horrendous from Boregate in the first place). There were more chances from Serbia than expected from this match and Boregate continues to surprise me&hellip;.in how AWFUL you can manage a team that&rsquo;s chock-full of talent like this. Bottled the World Cup in 2018 to Croatia and finished FOURTH. Decided to park the bus against Italy in the Euros, bottling what should have been an easy HOST COUNTRY WIN in 2021. And it didn&rsquo;t stop there after he managed to bottle it in the World Cup YET AGAIN losing to France where they were ACTUALLY the better team. This kind of approach to every game is just pathetic. Because, with this kind of talent in your ranks you can hold on and also score goals. Not doing that instead of doing this is just weird. Also, this is a pass map of England in today&rsquo;s match by <a href="https://x.com/OptaAnalyst/status/1802439324694118400">Opta</a>. Shows how much Kane dropped into the midfield putting nobody in front as usual and how isolated Foden really was on the left side. The thinner the line, the less passes there were between the nodes. Just all around poor to be honest. This match just made the record for the lowest shots for this tournament ever as well with 11. 6 from Serbia and 5 from England</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s had a really great season for his club, hitting the ground running immediately in his debut season for Real Madrid and also winning the Champions League as well. Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t see much of that here because of you know who, but he did have the movement to score that bullet header so it was given mostly for that. Apart from that he was part of a compact unit defending a 1 goal lead which was a normal everyday Monday under Boregate. No biggie 😑.</p>

<p>Well drilled Romania. Disjointed Ukraine. This wasn&rsquo;t in our script. What a win this is for Romania. And it was thoroughly well deserved. Ukraine were highly disjointed and didn&rsquo;t look well settled despite them having the better players for sure, but it doesn&rsquo;t work when you meet a team willing to work hard for each other and sit properly and are well drilled like Romania were. Fair play and they goals were absolutely top drawer too.</p>
<h2 id="1st-half-1">1st Half</h2>
<p>We begin at minute 29 against the run of play actually. Lunin plays a horrible pass under pressure and it came straight to a Romania player(He&rsquo;s literally called Man 😅 so I didn&rsquo;t say it here) who played it to Stanciu the captain and he unleashed a brilliant first time shot in the top corner. What a way to start the scoring. After this, it was really good play from Romania here and there and Ukraine just couldn&rsquo;t string the passes properly in the final third. Dovbyk was isolated, Mudryk couldn&rsquo;t do much and Tsygankov as well. Sudakov was hardly involved either and they were pinned back whenever Romania countered. Dennis Man hit a shot which was deflected away, the captain Stanciu hit the woodwork from a freaking CORNER which was absloutely mental</p>
<h2 id="2nd-half-1">2nd Half</h2>
<p>It went from bad to worse from Ukraine as Romania countered quickly after some possession. The player drifted in from the right but he lost it and the ball fell to Razvan Marin who took a first-time shot low down Lunin&rsquo;s right to make it 2-0. Almost 5 minutes later, a corner routine was well executed and Man found Dragus right in front of goal and he managed to tap it in easily and it passed the VAR check too. There was one great save from the keeper for Romania from Sudakov from outside the box but it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be. It was highly disjointed from them and they have to pick things up for their next match.</p>

<p>A true captain&rsquo;s performance from him 👏👏👏👏. The technique he has is absolutely crazy. The first time shot and then from the corner. Led the players around brilliantly and made sure they stuck to their tasks defensively.</p>

<p>Hancko the warrior. Misfiring Belgium. Why does Lukaku still start for Belgium? The shocks never end today as Slovakia have managed to get a shock win over group favorites Belgium which now leads to Romania leading the Group E table and Slovakia in 2nd. This was honestly well deserved. They attacked well and put Belgium under pressure even when they were defending and actually still kept attacking and were looking threatening. Let&rsquo;s dive into it.</p>
<h2 id="1st-half-2">1st Half</h2>
<p>We go to minute 7 where Doku plays a very loose ball, and it comes to Schranz who tees Bozenik who struck a good shot which was parried by Casteel, butt that parry fell straight to Schranz who made no mistake with the finish. There was no flag and VAR found no issue and Slovakia take an unlikely lead from a mistake by Doku. Doku tried to make amends really hard with his direct dribblin, and he almost did when he took on his man and managed to get a shot away on his left, but Skriniar was on hand to block it. Belgium got another chance where Dubravka was caught out by De Bruyne, but Trossard couldn&rsquo;t find the target and blazed over. There was a chance each where Bozenik from Slovakia on the edge of the box hit a fairly weak effort straight at the keeper and Onana from Belgium headed a corner from De Bruyne straight to Dubravka. Casteels was called to action properly when space opened up for Kucka to cross and Haraslin struck a solid volley which was palmed out of the top-right corner. Lukaku had more chances throughout this game and he missed 2 golden ones before Slovakia took the lead and he got another one where Carrasco found him with a lofted pass but he didn&rsquo;t control it well and it rolled harmlessly for a goal kick.</p>
<h2 id="2nd-half-2">2nd Half</h2>
<p>The 2nd half was more of the same from Slovakia, who were decently threatening whenever they had the ball which was really surprising. You had another chance from Lukaku after he played a good one-two with Trossard but Dubravka was alert to save it.There were a couple of VAR interventions. First was when Lukaku bundled the ball in when from a short corner Trossard crossed it and the header from Onana was put in by Lukaku but on further check it was chalked off to offside by a light shoulder. The second incident was when Openda managed to find Lukaku with the cut back, and he made no mistake(I thought FINALLY) but it was disallowed because Openda handballed it as he was controlling it(Looking back on it, it seemed harsh because he was half focusing on shielding the ball and it couldn&rsquo;t have been on purpose). There was a serious goal line clearance involved too by David Hancko which was seriously clutch from him. It was risky from Slovakia to start with at the back and Doku took it away. His cross was parried by Dubravka but the rebound fell to Bakayoko whose shot was blocked off the line by Hancko. Absolutely crazy but they held one with some help from VAR and them capitalizing on the mistakes of the Belgians.</p>

<p>A very good performance from him in the middle of that Slovakia midfield and was tasked with keeping one of the best number 10&rsquo;s in the world quiet and he did just that as they held on for a famous win and very important 3 points.</p>
